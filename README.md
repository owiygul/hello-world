A short description


I done goofed, the edits I made to the main were supposed to be here. I'm too lazy to go back so here I am making edits again. Oh well!
Hi, I'm Oscar. I'm 31, married with a Yorkie, and I enjoy biking, sailing, and guitar.
My favorite food is Vietnamese, followed by anything that my wife makes, followed by Southern comfort food.

I'm making another branch to fulfill the pull request section of the guide.
